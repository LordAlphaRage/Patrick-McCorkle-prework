    <p>My name is Patrick McCorkle and I am from Oshkosh, Wisconsin. I am a young professional who eagerly would like to make a career change. I majored in history, political science and Spanish in college, and then taught abroad, after paying my student loans. Now, I am ready for the next stage in my life.</p>
    <p>I developed a passion for reading at a young age thanks to my family, and that has developed into a hobby of writing in my adult years. When not reading or writing, I enjoy learning languages, running, playing video games and the occasional Netflix binge!</p>
